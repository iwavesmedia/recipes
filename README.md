# Symfony Flex Recipes

This repository is hosting Symfony Flex Recipes for all IWAVES Bundles.

## Contributing

Each recipe is a directory containing a `manifest.json` file. The `manifest.json` file contains the recipe metadata and the list of files to copy.

You can look into the [Symfony documentation](https://github.com/symfony/recipes#creating-recipes) for more information about the recipe format.
